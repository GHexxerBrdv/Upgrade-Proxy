# 🧠 Upgradeable Smart Contracts: An Educational Open Source Project

### 🚀 Learn & Contribute to Smart Contract Upgradability in Ethereum

There are **five major proxy upgradeability patterns** in Ethereum smart contract development:

- 🧱 Eternal Storage Proxy  
- 🔍 Transparent Proxy  
- 🔄 UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)  
- 🗼 Beacon Proxy  
- 💎 Diamond Proxy (EIP-2535)  

While these patterns are widely discussed in theory, **practical, minimal-to-advanced implementations** are hard to find — especially for beginners. This project fills that gap.

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project aims to **educate, guide, and encourage open-source collaboration** on the most used smart contract upgradeability patterns. Through minimalistic examples, contributors and learners will gain:

- 💡 Hands-on experience with Solidity and low-level EVM concepts like `delegatecall`  
- 🛠️ Practical exposure to how proxy patterns work under the hood  
- 📁 A starter portfolio for open-source contributions  
- 🤝 A chance to collaboratively build a modular and scalable resource for the Web3 ecosystem  

> The goal is not just to teach upgradeability — it’s to **demystify it** and make it accessible to everyone.

## 🧩 Why Proxy and Upgradability?

Smart contracts are **immutable by default** — once deployed, their code can't be changed. But in real-world applications, **bugs**, **feature requests**, or **protocol upgrades** require a way to **update logic** without losing user data or starting over.

So how do we change an unchangeable contract?

> “If you can’t change the logic of a smart contract, change the smart contract.”  
> — But keep the storage persistent and the user interface the same.

This is made possible by **proxy patterns**:  
> Contracts that **delegate calls** to other contracts, enabling logic upgrades while preserving state.

## 🛠️ Proxy Upgradeability Patterns

### 1. 🧱 Eternal Storage Pattern

**Key Components:**

- **Storage Contract**: Holds state variables as `mapping(bytes32 => uint256)` (key-value pairs)  
- **Logic Contract(s)**: Contains logic to interact with the storage  
- **Proxy Contract**: Routes user interaction to the logic contract  

**Flow:**



User → Proxy → Logic → Eternal Storage



**Purpose:** Keeps storage persistent even if logic changes. Useful when you want **logic flexibility** without losing data.

### 2. 🔍 Transparent Proxy Pattern (EIP-1967)

**Key Components:**

1. **Proxy Contract**  
2. **Implementation Contract** (holds business logic & storage)  
3. **Admin** (manages upgrades)  

**How it works:**

- Proxy stores implementation and admin addresses in specific EVM storage slots (defined by EIP-1967).  
- Only the **admin** can upgrade the contract.  
- Regular users can only access the implementation logic.

**EIP-1967 Storage Slots:**

```solidity
// Implementation
bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1)

// Admin
bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.admin")) - 1)
```

**Benefit:** Separation of concerns — clear distinction between admin and user.

---

### 3. 🔄 UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)

**Difference from Transparent Proxy:**

* Upgrade function is placed **inside the implementation** (not in the proxy).
* Only one storage slot for implementation is required.
* **Cheaper deployment** compared to Transparent Proxy.

**Warning:** Implementation contracts must include upgrade logic. If omitted or implemented incorrectly, further upgrades will be blocked.

---

### 4. 🗼 Beacon Proxy Pattern

**Key Components:**

* **Beacon Contract**: Stores the address of the implementation
* **Proxy Contract(s)**: Refer to the beacon for logic
* **Implementation Contract**: Contains business logic

**Flow:**

```
Multiple Proxies → Beacon → Implementation
```

**Benefit:** A single beacon can update logic for **multiple proxies**, saving gas and simplifying upgrades in systems with many instances (like DeFi protocols or NFTs).

---

### 5. 💎 Diamond Proxy Pattern (EIP-2535)

The most modular and complex pattern.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Diamond (Proxy)**: Routes function selectors to multiple implementation contracts
* **Facets (Implementations)**: Contain chunks of logic (functions)
* **DiamondCut**: Mechanism to add/replace/remove facets

**Why use it?**

* Split logic into modules
* Upgrade and manage large contracts without storage collisions
* Used in projects like **Aavegotchi**, **Uniswap V3**, etc.

---

## 💡 Real-World Scope and Importance

> Upgradeability isn’t just a theoretical concept — it powers real, large-scale Web3 projects:

* **OpenZeppelin** provides production-ready upgradable contracts
* **Uniswap** used proxy patterns to evolve V2 → V3 without users losing funds
* **DAO governance** and **decentralized upgradability** are based on these patterns

**Understanding and mastering proxy patterns** prepares you for building scalable, secure, and maintainable smart contracts in the real world.
